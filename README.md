•	Proposed a new 3-2 adder compressor circuit with less transistor count for CPUs, microprocessors, and memory systems 

•	Objective: Reduced transistor count, circuit size, and enhanced seven performances of the circuit 

•	Aimed for faster data processing in digital signal processors 

•	Used Cadence Virtuoso and H Spice tools for simulation and validation
